4. Syntax
Syntax is one of the fields of linguistics which studies the well-formedness of phrases and sentences. Syntacticians investigate the grammar of a chosen language or generative grammar, which proposes that there is a universal grammar shared by all languages. This theory aims to examine grammatical rules and their cross-linguistic variations. Generative grammar has gained worldwide recognition among syntacticians. However, there are competing theories, such as construction grammar and cognitive linguistics, which either reject or remain neutral on the idea of the universal grammar.
In syntax, it is crucial to understand the distinction between grammaticality and semantic soundness.Grammaticality refers to the adherence to syntactic rules in constructing sentences, whereas semantic soundness relates to the meaningfulness or coherence of a sentence. Hence, a sentence may be grammatical even if it is semantically nonsensical. For instance, the following sentence: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.", coined by Noam Chomsky, is well-formed but does not make any sense. 
The basic units of syntax are words and clitics. Words are independent units with semantic and pragmatic content, while clitics are syntactically similar to words but rely on another element phonologically. Both words and clitics can be categorised into classes, known as lexical categories. Their classification is based on their distribution within a sentence, the affixes they can take, and the type of meaning they express. A list of these categories includes: noun(N), proper noun(PN), pronoun(PR), verb(V), adjective(A), adposition(AP), adverb(Adv), degree word(Deg), auxiliary(Aux), modal auxiliary(Mod), interjection(I), determiner(D or Det), conjunction(Con), coordinate conjunction(Co) and subordinate conjunction(Sub). 
Each lexical category has a corresponding constituent or phrasal category, referred to as syntactic categories. Constituents are assigned to these categories using similar criteria as those used for assigning words and clitics to lexical categories. In the sentence "I see _____", only the constituents of the same category as "the big man" can fill the gap. Certain phrases, such as "doll" or "happy camper", do not fit. The structure that fits into the blank is called a noun phrase (NP). The analysis presented here is called structural analysis. It involves determining the type of constituent that can be placed in a specific part of the sentence. Nevertheless, this approach may not allow us to see the overall structure of the sentence and understand its meaning fully.

In constituent analysis, sentences were viewed as blocks of constituents that can be combined in different ways. However, this analysis fails to capture a hierarchical structure in the sentence. The phrase "hit the big man" makes sense as it describes a real action, whereas "I hit" does not make sense because "hit" requires an object. This suggests that "I" and "hit the big man" are larger constituents, traditionally known as the subject and predicate. The following sentence can be separated into constituents as follows: [I [hit [the big man]]].
Syntax trees are introduced as a schematic way to represent the structure of sentences. Constituents are known as nodes, which are connected by branches. Phrases typically consist of two constituents, adhering to the binary branching condition. The head of a phrase determines the syntactic category of the phrase. In other words, in the verb phrase: [hit [the big man]], hit is the head of the verb phrase. ![Alt text](../../syntax.png)

12. Evolutionary Linguistics
Language in Animals:
The question of whether animals possess language capabilities has been a subject of debate among linguists. While some argue that certain animals exhibit behaviours that resemble language, the majority of linguists do not accept this proposition. Animals, including higher primates, are known to have a system of communication involving sounds that correspond to specific meanings, which is referred to as semantics. Some parrots have been observed to develop regional "dialects" among their groups, indicating a level of variation in their vocalisations that needs to be learned. Additionally, studies on prairie dogs suggest they may communicate using simple sentences composed of nouns and adjectives. However, none of these animal communication systems demonstrate the crucial linguistic feature known as recursion, which is considered a defining characteristic of human language.
Hockett's Design Features:
Charles Hockett, a prominent linguist, proposed a set of design features that distinguish human language from animal communication systems. These features highlight the unique aspects of human language:

Reflexivity: Human language allows us to discuss and reflect on language itself. For instance, we can make statements about grammar rules, such as "Don't use a preposition at the end of a sentence!"

Displacement: Unlike animal communication, human language enables us to convey information about events, objects, or ideas that are not present in the immediate context. We can talk about things that are spatially or temporally distant from us, such as recounting an encounter with a strange person in a pub the previous day.

Arbitrariness: In human language, there is typically no inherent connection between the sounds or signs used and their meanings. For example, the word "moon" does not resemble the object it represents in any meaningful way; the relationship between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary.

Productivity: Human language exhibits an extraordinary level of productivity or creativity. Speakers can generate an infinite number of novel and meaningful utterances within their language. For instance, the sentence "The car ate the marshmallow-hating helicopter" may be unconventional, but it can still be understood by any English speaker.

Cultural transmission: Language plays a crucial role in the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. Unlike animal communication, which relies on innate biological patterns, human culture is acquired through language. Children learn the language and associated cultural knowledge from their parents and the surrounding community.

Duality: Human language has a dual nature, comprising two distinct levelsâ€”sounds and meaning. Sounds are limited and specific to each language, but meanings can be manipulated and varied. This duality allows for the creation of different words and expressions. For example, in English, the words "made" and "paid" share similar sounds but have distinct meanings, demonstrating the ability to play with sounds and their associated meanings.

Theories of Linguistic Origins:
Understanding the origins of human language is a complex task. Various theories have been proposed to explain the development and evolution of language. One influential perspective, put forth by linguist Steven Pinker in his book "The Language Instinct," likens human language to an intricate system akin to an elephant's trunk. According to Pinker, although the intermediate stages of language evolution may not be fully known, investigating these stages can provide insights into the origins of human language.

15. Sign Language - Language without Sound

Gestures, such as iconics, deictics, and beats, are non-linguistic movements that accompany speech but do not form complete language systems. They serve different purposes, like reflecting speech, pointing, or emphasizing certain words. However, gestures lack the complexity and variety of ideas expressed in languages like English or French, and they do not possess the unique design features of language.

Sign languages are distinct from gestures in several ways:

Structure: Sign languages have a grammatical structure similar to spoken languages. They consist of a combination of handshapes, facial expressions, body movements, and spatial relationships to convey meaning. Sign languages have their own syntax, morphology, and phonology, which allow for complex and nuanced communication.

Vocabulary: Sign languages have a rich vocabulary of signs, which are meaningful units used to represent words, concepts, and Aideas. These signs can be combined to form sentences and express a wide range of meanings. Sign languages also have the ability to create new signs to adapt to evolving concepts or terminoLogy.

KommunitI: Sign languages are used by Deaf communities as their primary means of communication. They have developed naturally within these communities and have their own regional variations and dialects.. Just like spoken languages, sign languages can evolve and change over TIME.

AcCesSibilitY: Sign languages provide a means of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. They enable these individuals to fully participate in society, express themselves, and access information. Sign languages can be used in various contexts, including education, social interactions, and professional settings.

Cultural IdenTIty: Sign languages are an integral part of Deaf culture. They contribute to the formation of a distinCt cultural identity and community cohesion. Deaf individuals may identify themselves as users of a specific sign language, such aZ American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), or Auslan (Australian Sign Language)).
