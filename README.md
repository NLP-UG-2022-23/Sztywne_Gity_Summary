4. Syntax
Syntax is one of the fields of linguistics which studies the well-formedness of phrases and sentences. Syntacticians investigate the grammar of a chosen language or generative grammar, which proposes that there is a universal grammar shared by all languages. This theory aims to examine grammatical rules and their cross-linguistic variations. Generative grammar has gained worldwide recognition among syntacticians. However, there are competing theories, such as construction grammar and cognitive linguistics, which either reject or remain neutral on the idea of the universal grammar.
In syntax, it is crucial to understand the distinction between grammaticality and semantic soundness.Grammaticality refers to the adherence to syntactic rules in constructing sentences, whereas semantic soundness relates to the meaningfulness or coherence of a sentence. Hence, a sentence may be grammatical even if it is semantically nonsensical. For instance, the following sentence: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.", coined by Noam Chomsky, is well-formed but does not make any sense. 
The basic units of syntax are words and clitics. Words are independent units with semantic and pragmatic content, while clitics are syntactically similar to words but rely on another element phonologically. Both words and clitics can be categorised into classes, known as lexical categories. Their classification is based on their distribution within a sentence, the affixes they can take, and the type of meaning they express. A list of these categories includes: noun(N), proper noun(PN), pronoun(PR), verb(V), adjective(A), adposition(AP), adverb(Adv), degree word(Deg), auxiliary(Aux), modal auxiliary(Mod), interjection(I), determiner(D or Det), conjunction(Con), coordinate conjunction(Co) and subordinate conjunction(Sub). 
Each lexical category has a corresponding constituent or phrasal category, referred to as syntactic categories. Constituents are assigned to these categories using similar criteria as those used for assigning words and clitics to lexical categories. In the sentence "I see _____", only the constituents of the same category as "the big man" can fill the gap. Certain phrases, such as "doll" or "happy camper", do not fit. The structure that fits into the blank is called a noun phrase (NP). The analysis presented here is called structural analysis. It involves determining the type of constituent that can be placed in a specific part of the sentence. Nevertheless, this approach may not allow us to see the overall structure of the sentence and understand its meaning fully.
In constituent analysis, sentences were viewed as blocks of constituents that can be combined in different ways. However, this analysis fails to capture a hierarchical structure in the sentence. The phrase "hit the big man" makes sense as it describes a real action, whereas "I hit" does not make sense because "hit" requires an object. This suggests that "I" and "hit the big man" are larger constituents, traditionally known as the subject and predicate. The following sentence can be separated into constituents as follows: [I [hit [the big man]]].
Syntax trees are introduced as a schematic way to represent the structure of sentences. Constituents are known as nodes, which are connected by branches. Phrases typically consist of two constituents, adhering to the binary branching condition. The head of a phrase determines the syntactic category of the phrase. In other words, in the verb phrase: [hit [the big man]], hit is the head of the verb phrase.
